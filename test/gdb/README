 The gdb-test directory is essentially a clone of the hello-test directory,
 modulo some modifications (only in the various scripts) to customize the
 set-up.

 The basic purpose here is to test the GDB hypervisor stub. Using a GDB that
 has e500mc support, you should be able to remote connect to port 9124 upon a
 'target remote :9124' in GDB. That should get you remote connected to the
 hypervisor's stub which will be used to debug guests running on top of the
 hypervisor.

 To Run, follow Stuart's instructions off of his Wikipage and type:

	 'make gdb-hello'

 (instead of 'make test-hello' as you would do for the hello test).

 Caution: This is Work In Progress.
