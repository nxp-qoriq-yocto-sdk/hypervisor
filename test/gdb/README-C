0. In top-level HV directory, do a: make test-gdb-run-C
1. At the Simics prompt: simics> c
2. In test/gdb, invoke: ./run-gdb-C.sh
   This will bring up four xterms with GDB sessions, with
   text like:

Hardware assisted breakpoint 1 at 0x20003884: file /proj/.ppc_07/labhome/b07584/hv-test/test/gdb/gdb-whoami.c, line 88.

Breakpoint 1, debug_code (pir=2)
    at /proj/.ppc_07/labhome/b07584/hv-test/test/gdb/gdb-whoami.c:88
88              if (!gdb_attached[pir]) /* Set at GDB prompt. */
(gdb)

3. To step through debug_code(), do a:
(gdb) set gdb_attached[pir] = 1
