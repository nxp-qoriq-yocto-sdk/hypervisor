.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIpartman\fR is a Linux utility that interfaces to the Freescale Embedded Hypervisor to provide partition management services.  It relies on the hypervisor partition
management Linux device driver, fsl_hypervisor.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fBstatus\fR
Display the full names and status of all managed partitions, doorbells, and
byte channels.
.TP
\fBload\fR
Load an image into a partition's memory.
.TP
\fBstart\fR
Start a partition.
.TP
\fBstop\fR
Stop a partition.
.TP
\fBdoorbell\fR
Listen for doorbells (if \fB\-f\fR specified), or ring a doorbell
(if \fB\-h\fR specified).
.TP
\fBsetprop\fR
Sets a guest device tree property for the specified partition.
.TP
\fBgetprop\fR
Gets a guest device tree property for the specified partition.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR handle
For the \fBdoorbell\fR command, this specifies the send handle of the doorbell
to ring.  For all other commands, this specifies the handle of the target
partition.  In all cases, the doorbell or partition full name can be used
instead of the handle number.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR file
For the \fBdoorbel\fR command, this specifies the program to run when a doorbell
is received.  This can be any program that can be executed by the shell.
\fBpartman\fR passes the doorbell handle as a parameter to this script.

For all other commands, this specifies the name of the file to
load.  If this file is an ELF image, the ELF headers will be
parsed and PT_LOAD segments will be extracted and copied to the target
partition in the right order.  If it us a uncompressed UIMAGE file, the payload
of the UIMAGE is extracted and copied to the target partition.
Otherwise, the file is treated as a single binary blob.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR address
Optional guest physical address where the image should go.  For ELF images, this
parameter defaults to the base physical address in the image.  For binary
images, the default is 0.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR address
Optional guest physical address of execution entry point.  For ELF images, this
parameter defaults to the entry point in the image.  For binary images,
the default is 0.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR dtpath
Device tree path.  A string that specifies the full path to the node for which
the property is being accessed.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR propname
Property name.  A string that specifies the name of the property which is being
accessed.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR data
A string that is that value to write to the specified property using the \fBsetprop\fR command.
Integer and other binary values are not supported.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR
Verbose output.  Useful for debugging.
.TP
\fB\-q\fR
Quiet mode. Errors reported via return status only.
