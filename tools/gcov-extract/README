To run code coverage on HV compile with gcov enabled in menuconfig
and follow the steps below:

----------------------------------------------------------
Running on hardware

1. Start gcov enabled HV and run your tests to completion.
2. Run mux_server connecting directly to serial port (/dev/tty...).
   Make sure skermit was not left running.

     mux_server -s 115200 /dev/ttyQ06e2 8000 8001 8002 8003 8004 8005 \
     8006 8007 8008 8009 8010 8011 8012 8013 8014 8015 8016 8017 8018 \
     8019 8020 8021 8022 8023 8024 8025 8026 8027 8028 8029 8030 8031

3. Run gcov-extract tool. If you get version mismatch errors, update the
   '--host-libgcov-version' parameter to the version mentioned in the errors
   and re-run.

    gcov-extract --host-libgcov-version=401p -v localhost:8031

4. Run 'make gcov' on the HV directory. The .gcov files will be extracted in 'output/bin'.

----------------------------------------------------------
Running on simics

1. Before starting the simulation make sure that the simics 'net console'
   is in raw mode.

    p4080ds.net_console0.con->raw = TRUE

2. Start gcov enabled HV and run your tests to completion.
3. Follow steps 2 - 4 from 'Running on hardware'.
