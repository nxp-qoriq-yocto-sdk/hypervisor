Freescale Hypervisor Release Notes

Topaz Version: 1.3
Revision: 005
Date: 09/13/2013

This document identifies changes between Embedded
Hypervisor releases.

Detailed List of Changes
   -v1.3-005 bug fixes and changes
       -adding a secondary thread to a coherency subdomain broke the subdomain
        causing random kernel hangs
   -v1.3-004 bug fixes and changes
       -fixed a context synchronization issue in thread starting code that
        caused the guests not to start because the secondary threads were
        crashing
       -fixed compilation error triggering with gcc-4.8.1
       -couple of smaller fixes in tlb management code
       -small re-factoring and improvements in tests
   -v1.3-003 bug fixes and changes
       -reduced hypervisor's binary image footprint by ~400KB (around 40%-50%)
       -fixed a memory corruption happening on 64-bit targets
       -e6500 l1 cache is shared but no synchronization was in place causing
        core hangs. Fixed by implementing "shared resource synchronization" as
        defined and required in "e6500 Core RefMan, chapter 3.3.3.1"
       -added two new hw thread APIs in libos:
        * pause_other_hw_threads()
        * resume_other_hw_threads()

   -v1.3-002 bug fixes and changes
       -introducing multi-threading support on e6500 cores
        * each thread shows up in guest as a single threaded e6500 core
       -added support for the following T4 hw blocks
        * mpic
        * guts
        * ccf
        * cpc
       -updated driver model to support multiple compatibles per driver
       -fixes to work with newer gcc versions
        * r3 register was clobbered in bootstrap code thus the
          pointer to the device tree was lost
        * .notes section added in linker script
       -misc t4240 related fixes
       -test updates and a few minor code clean-ups

   -v1.3-001 bug fixes and changes
       -initial e6500 core support featuring MMUv2, LRAT, hw pagewalk
       -e6500 support known limitations:
        * most of the SoC hw blocks are unsupported (cpc, ddr, l2 cache a.s.o.)
        * threads are not supported
        * ccm must be explicitly disabled either by removing the nodes from
          hv config dts or by tweaking the code
       -added options in the HV config file to configure TLB behavior:
        * direct-guest-tlb-miss: tlb misses directed to the guest
        * direct-guest-tlb-mgt: tlb management instructions (tlbwe, tlbilx)
          are allowed in guest
       -tlb0 caching was disabled on e6500 cores (support for this is not useful
        and would impact performance on other platforms)
       -add support for cache-able spin-table, epapr conformance
       -add support to handle altivec exceptions
       -libos: simple thread api and example

   -v0.7-005 bug fixes and changes
       -DMA is now disabled by default, to be enabled with
        an hcall when the driver is ready (especially important
        after a partition reset).  For compatibility, a partition
        can specify no-dma-disable and get the old behavior.
        no-dma-disable can also be specified on a specific
        device when it targets shared memory.  defer-dma-disable
        can be specified on a partition, in which case when
        a partition is stopped, DMA is not disabled until a manager
        issues the new FH_PARTITION_STOP_DMA hcall.
       -added support for resetting hv if all partitions become stopped
       -hv watchdog support, and misc timer fixes/cleanup
       -added zero-pma property, allowing shared memory regions to
        be set to a known state on hv boot
       -added load parameter to partition start hcall, matching
        the shell's "start load" command
       -timebase now runs while napping, keeping the clocks
        in sync
       -partman no longer needs to malloc the entire BSS for the
        file it's loading
       -expose get_vcpu_state() for debug stub API
       -fix race in claim hcall if there are multiple partitions
        trying to claim at once
       -don't let guests set DBCR0[EDM]
       -improve robustness with certain classes of partition
        config errors

       -support for PCI when guest phys != true phys
        is removed
       -guest error queues is represented with node

       -migrate access violations in guest error queue
        on a device claim
       -support for claim of error manager
       -error manger is represented with a node in
        guest device trees
       -err_get_info hcall now takes a handle to the guest
        error queue or error manager as argument
       -64-bit cleanup in fast TLB path
       -error management support for PAMU operation errors
        and PAMU ECC errors

       -updated vendor ID for hcalls

   -v0.7-002 bug fixes and changes
       -hcalls have been updated to be ePAPR compliant
       -guest device tree compatibles have been updated to
        be ePAPR compliant-- byte-channels, doorbells,
        vmpic
       -device claim feature is implemented
       -CPC error handling is implemented
       -64-bit cleanup sufficient to run a test 32-bit
