1.  Introduction

   This document identifies changes between Topaz 
   releases and a list of limitations.

-------------------------------------------------------
2.  Compatibility/Dependencies

   -Topaz 0.2-rc1
      -is compatible with Simics 8578 3.2.27
      -requires device tree compiler (DTC) SHA tag
       fc9769ac2bae8a32d5d277007d22414c4516b02 with the 
       libfdt patch applied as described in the Topaz
       README.txt

4.  Limitations


 A. CPU Feature Limitations

   -MMU
      -invalid MMU mappings are permitted to be written into
       the TLB, and a machine check will occur on access to
       the mapping--  this is not implemented for TLB1.  Access
       to invalid TLB1 mappings will result in another TLB miss

   -physical addresses greater than 32 bits are not supported

   -HID0
      -the HID0 register is not implemented-- writes to it 
       are ignored

   -CPU core performance monitor support
      -support for the CPU performance monitor instructions,
       registers, and interrupts is not implemented

   -CPU core Debug support
      -CPU debug support is not implemented including all debug
       registers and interrupts
      -writes to debug SPRs are ignored

   -L1 cache control
      -the L1 cache control registers are not implemented
         L1CSR0
         L1CSR1
         L1CSR2

   -L2 cache control
      -the L2 cache control registers are not implemented
         L2CAPTDATAHI
         L2CAPTDATALO
         L2CAPTECC
         L2CSR0
         L2CSR1
         L2ERRADDR
         L2ERRATTR
         L2ERRCTL
         L2ERRDET
         L2ERRDIS
         L2ERREADDR
         L2ERRINJCTL
         L2ERRINJHI
         L2ERRINJLO
         L2ERRINTEN

   -Power management
      -support for the MSR[WE] power management bit is not
       implemented

   -"Guest debug mode" as defined by the Topaz spec is not
    implemented

   -"Guest cache lock mode" as defined by the Topaz spec is not
    implemented


 B. Platform Feature Limitations

   -Coherence subdomains
      -support for coherence subdomains is not implemented

   -L3 / Platform Cache configuration is not implemented

   -platform error interrupts
      -in the platform MPIC multiple error interrupts are multiplexed
       to interrupt 0.  De-multiplexing and routing of platform
       error interrupts to partitions is not implemented.

 C. Hypervisor Services Limitations

   -Partition Management
      -partition management interrupts (as specified in the
       Topaz spec) are not implemented:
         -partition state change 
         -watchdog expiration
         -restart request

   -GPIO services-- GPIO services as specified in the Topaz
    spec are not implemented

   -Debug console
      -the hypervisor debug console is partially implemented
       and input is not supported

   -gdb stub
      -the gdb stub is not implemented
      -the gdb stub does not support hardware breakpoints or
       hardware watchpoints
