Building the hypervisor

    NOTE: If dtc is not installed in ../dtc relative to the hypervisor,
    you must pass DTC_DIR=<path to dtc> in all make invocations.

    You must also pass CROSS_COMPILE=<cross compiler prefix>.  E.g.
    "make CROSS_COMPILE=powerpc-linux-gnu-" or
    "export CROSS_COMPILE=powerpc-linux-gnu-; make".

    * to build the hypervisor
          o cd hv
          o git submodule init
          o git submodule update
          o make defconfig
          o make
    * to build the tests
          o make test
    * to build a specific test "foo"
          o make test-foo
    * to run a specific test "foo" in simics
          o make test-foo-run
    * Some tests have multiple variants.
      To run a specific test variant "bar" in simics:
          o make test-foo-run-bar

Source tree directory structure

   The hypervisor uses libos and the libfdt library from the device
   tree compiler.  Descriptions of the source directories are
   below:

   libos/include        libos library includes
   libos/lib            libos library source
   src                  hypervisor source
   include              hypervisor includes
   tools                misc tools
   tools/mux_server     The UART multiplexer-- runs on a host system
   tools/partman        The Linux user space partition manager tool
   test                 Hypervisor unit tests
   test/common          files shared by the tests
